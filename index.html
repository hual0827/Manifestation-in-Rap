      <p><i>"To everyone who sell me drugs: <br>
          Don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hopin' not to join the 27 Club"</i><br>
        - Mac Miller</p>


      <!-- <p>Have you noticed that a lot of rappers have been dying from either drugs or violence? Like, even more than
        usual? And that they tend to rap a lot about those very topics?
        Alright, I'll cool it with the rhetorical questions. Mac Miller and Juice WRLD, both rappers loved by the world,
        died of overdosing in recent years. Both seemed to rap heavily
        about drugs. Did they predict their own demise? Did they write their own story? Did they manifest their own
        death? Ok, now I'm really done with the rhetorical questions.</p>
      <p>To quantitatively test this hypothesis, I took ____ rappers, aggregated 35,000 lyrics for each rapper (drawing
        from their most popular albums) and counted the number of times
        they mentioned drugs using a simple keyword search.</p> -->

    <section id="intro3">
      <p>Malcolm James McCormick, known professionally as Mac Miller, did not join the 27 Club. He was one year away,
        dying from a drug overdose at 26. About a month before his death, he released an album called Swimming in
        August. <br><br>One of the most talked
        about lines from the album is "That Mercedes drove me crazy, I was speedin'." How come that line got so much
        attention?
        Well, a few months before Swimming was released, he was arrested under suspicion of DUI after crashing his
        Mercedes into a power pole. <br><br>
        Many listeners assumed he wrote the song after crashing the car. However, here is a quote from Mac Miller in an
        interview with Craig Jenkins...

      <p><i>"Stuff like that always happens with my music. These themes will just connect because of, maybe, a state of
          mind I was in. [...]
          I’ll say a line like, “that Mercedes drove me crazy, I was speeding” I made that song way before the shit went
          down. You just have
          to get out of your own way, and everything will just connect for itself. [...] the story writes itself."
        </i></p>
    </section>

    <section id="intro5">
      <p>Even more recently, Jarad Anthony Higgins, AKA Juice WRLD, also died of an overdose. How come these rappers,
        loved by the world, are dying?
        As you will see in the dataset, Juice WRLD rapped heavily about drugs.<br><br>
        Maybe artists are just making art about what they already know. Maybe their rhymes are perpetuating their
        habits.
        Maybe being in the rap game pushes them to make explicit art, eventually manifesting in their real lives. Maybe
        all of the above.
        I'll let you decide, but I'll give you some numbers that might help.<br><br>
        I took 81 rappers, aggregated 35,000 lyrics from each rapper (drawing from their most popular albums) and
        counted the number of times
        they mentioned drugs using a simple keyword search... Does how often they mention drugs correlate to how they
        end up dying?

            <p>This chart shows how many times, out of 35,000 lyrics, a drug-related word was detected for each of these
              rappers. A purple colored bar means that
              the rapper died from overdosing.

            <h2 style="color:#FC7E1D"><b>Violence</b></h2>
            <p>What about violence? In recent years, XXXTentacion and Takeoff were both shot. If we go back to the 90's,
              we'll find plenty more rappers that have died
              of violent causes, including Biggie and 2Pac.
            </p>
            <p>This chart shows how many times a violence-related word was detected for each of these rappers. An orange
              colored bar means that
              the rapper died from a violent cause, like getting shot or stabbed.

            <p>There are many other words for death that don't necessarily have anything to do with drugs or violence.
              This chart shows how many times the rapper talked about death
              by counting the number of times they said words like "death", "suicide", or "void". A yellow colored bar
              means that the rapper died an unnatural death.

            <p>Let's combine all the words we've counted so far (drugs, violence, and death-related words) and call them
              "Deadly Words" with the intent to see whether or not
              rappers are more likely to die of unnatural causes if they use more "Deadly
              Words".
            </p>
            <p>It is apparent with a glance of these charts that there is some relationship between how much people rap

      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Deriving Meaning</b></h2><br>
      <p>Let's be honest, manifestation is more of a buzz word than an indisputable reason why we are seeing this
        correlation between how often rappers rap about deadly words 
        and how they end up dying. It makes sense that people make art about what they already know and what they are
        exposed to regularly. It also makes sense
        that making art glorifying such negative topics perpetuates the same behavior. <br><br>Personally, I think it is
        pointless to investigate what came first between the
        environment or the art. Rather, we should make an effort to conciously notice what we are giving our attention
        to and how that is translating into our
        everyday lives. <br>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Reflection Questions</b></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can and should we use this information, assuming it can indeed predict causes of unnatural death, to identify and help individuals/groups?</li>
        <li>What can explain the increase in drug-related rapping in the 21st century? Or, conversely, the decrease in violence/death-related rapping.</li>
        <li>Can other people's art translate into my own life as I expose myself to it?</li>
        <li>How can I be concious about what I "manifest" into my own life?</li>
        <li>What kind of environment do I want to expose myself to?</li>
